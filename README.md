# FlexFit+
The purpose of this application is to allow users to track their workouts, create new workouts, and be able to search a database of useful workouts.

# Description
This application was made with react router. There are 13 different components that make up the entire app. The whole idea behind it was we wanted a user to be able to track their workouts so they can remember their previouse workouts. We added other functionality, such as a profile aspect where a user can see their name, streak of days working out, total workouts, and thenumber of workouts they've done this week. Right under that is a begin workout button. This button autonmatically starts a timer to time your workout. As well as a form pops up so the user can create a new exercise that they want to log. On the next tab their is a history component showing users their entire history of workouts. As well as a favorite button on each workout card so users can see which workouts they like the best. The last component is a browse aspect. Users are able to browse a database filled with workouts that they can use. There are two search categories, they can search by which muscle they want to workouts along with what type of workout that they are doing.
